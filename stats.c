 * @brief Source code file for statistical Analysis of a given dataset
 *
 * This file contains a couple of functions that can analyze an array of unsigned
 * char data items and report analytics on the maximum, minimum, mean, and 
 * median of the data set. After analysis and sorting is done, the data is 
 * displayed to the screen in nicely formatted presentation.
